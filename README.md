you can install pycharm and create a virtual environment and download a video for object detection and you have to name it as "pose.mp4" and store it in the same environment

then you have to install two files they are "yolov8m.pt" and "yolov8m-pose.pt" from the internet

in this code, 4,7 code line actually used for live pose detection and 3,6 lines are used for object detection

for pose detection ,you have to use code line 4,7 by remove the '#' and put '#' for other two line 3,6
